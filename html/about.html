<h2>Logo</h2>
<div class="block-about__des">

The number ‘50’ and time period ‘1971 – 2021’ is a direct representation of how far the Singapore Organisation of Seamen (SOS) has reached today since it registered as a maritime trade union on 30th October 1971. It has been a fairly long journey for the organization; a milestone we can celebrate together—50th anniversary. ​The reason for using the element of waves—and water—as the font design for ‘50’ is to encapsulate, other than depicting the sea, what SOS is and what it does as a trade union—especially for the unacquainted.​<br /><br />

The liquid elements show how SOS is related to the maritime scene. It is a trade union, one of the tripartite partners in the local maritime industry. It loyally serves both local and international seafarers, be it if they are members or not—to fight their battles with them, for them. To put it simply, sticking with seafarers till the end, through thick and thin.​<br /><br />

To that end, SOS possesses not just that unwavering love for the sea, but for the seafarers they serve as well. This explains the curvature and blend of the number ‘0’ and wave to display the shape of a heart.​<br /><br />

This brings us to the colours of the logo: blue and red. It goes without saying, the colour blue represents the colour of the sea. Red, on the other, represents the passion of the union in doing what we do every day; the importance of why we do what we do every day, and, more importantly, out of love for the seafarers around us.​<br /><br />

Beyond these aspects, one of the many achievements of SOS is establishing the Seacare Co-Operative/Foundation. The colours blue and red, one way or the other, also draw subtle association between SOS and Seacare to the audience.<br /><br />

<h2>Many Stories One SOS</h2>
<div class="block-about-1__des">For starters, it highlights the same arduous journey every organization, every company, every trade union, has to be where they are at today. For this, however, it is SOS’ version, it’s SOS’ adventure.​Whether it is from the stakeholders themselves, the team, the members, the seafarers, each group of people would’ve faced their fair share of challenges with SOS, received a good amount of support from SOS, and contributed significant efforts in spearheading SOS to where it is at today.​<br /><br />
“Many Stories” wraps around all the different perspectives and circumstances; in addition, it comprises a good and wide spread of the good, the bad, and the ugly. All of which—and what important is—one way or the other converges to one thing: Help built SOS brick-by-brick for over 50 years. And it will continue to do so, for the next 10, 50, and even 100. This is why the slogan then ends with “One SOS”.</div>
